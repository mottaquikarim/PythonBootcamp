# Scraping Webpages and APIs

Here we will apply what we have learned about the basics of python to do more useful things in terms of data accumulation. Specifically, we will look into how we can harvest data that might be useful for processing from online sources: webpages and publicly available APIs.


## Rules of Engagement
For all exercises, partner with someone next to you. Coding is **collaborating**. Talk through each problem and attempt to arrive at the solution **together**. Remember, it's ok to break stuff and get things wrong, that's the **only** way to learn!


## THEME: Automating Life

🎉🎈🎂🍾🎊🍻💃

We are superpowered pythonic humans! Let's use our powers for good/evil! In this unit, we will look at how we can make our lives easier by gathering data freely available on websites in a structured and repeatable manner.
