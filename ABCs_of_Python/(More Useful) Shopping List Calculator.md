# (More Useful) Shopping List Calculator



Ok so our prototype is done! It works! Let's make it more useful. Specifically, let's try to solicit **user input** as part of our program.

* Create a new file, `shopping_list_user.py`
* Pull over the **5 variables** from `shopping_list.py`.
* Now, for each shopping item, **ask the user** how many of the items s/he would like to purchase.
* Find the sum now with user preferences in mind.
* Find total owed based off of sum.

**Sample output**
