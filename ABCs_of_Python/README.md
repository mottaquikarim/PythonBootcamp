# ABCs of Python

We will begin by exploring some of the basics of the python programming language. For example, how can we keep track of data in python? How does decision making work? Can we automate functionality so that we don't have to repeat ourselves? These are just some of the questions we'll tackle in this unit.

For all exercises, partner with someone next to you. Coding is **collaborating**. Talk through each problem and attempt to arrive at the solution **together**. Remember, it's ok to break stuff and get things wrong, that's the **only** way to learn!
## THEME: Death and Taxes

🎉🎈🎂🍾🎊🍻💃

We are a new startup! Cool! Our product has to do with tax calculation and other related financial services. In this unit, we will grow as a team, ramping up our python skills as we build our final product.

### Simple Shopping List Calculator

Let's begin by building a simple shopping list. 

* Create **5 variables** in python that store prices for items at the supermarket. 
* Write some code that will **sum** the prices of these items, store into a variable called `sum`
* Assuming NYC sales tax (8.875%), create another variable, `total_due` that represents how much our shopper owes. 

**Not sure where to begin??** Get used to it fam, that's 80% of programming! Here's [some cheatsheets](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/cheatsheets/README.html) tho.

**Sample output**
```
steak: $4.00/lb
tomatoes: $0.75/lb
redbull: $10.00
lentils: $0.45/lb
orange juice: $3.45
----------------------
sum: $18.65
total_due: $20.31
```

By sample output I mean that your program should print out something similar to what I have there above.
