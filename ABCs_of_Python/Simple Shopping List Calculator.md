# 1. Simple Shopping List Calculator

Let's begin by building a simple shopping list. 

* Create a new file, `shopping_list.py`
* Create **5 variables** in python that store prices for items at the supermarket. 
* Write some code that will **sum** the prices of these items, store into a variable called `sum`
* Assuming NYC sales tax (8.875%), create another variable, `total_due` that represents how much our shopper owes. 

**Not sure where to begin??** Get used to it fam, that's 80% of programming! Here's [some cheatsheets](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/cheatsheets/README.html) tho.

**Sample output**
```
steak: $4.00/lb
tomatoes: $0.75/lb
redbull: $10.00
lentils: $0.45/lb
orange juice: $3.45
----------------------
sum: $18.65
total_due: $20.31
```

By sample output I mean that your program should print out something similar to what I have there above.
