# PYTHON: THE BASICS

*A hands on and practical introduction
 to programming and python development.*

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce some fundamental concepts of software development. We will be using the python programming language, which provides a readable, powerful syntax that is used by data scientists, web developers, even NASA engineers! In particular, our aspiration in this workshop is to work up to a point where we can confidently and feasibly level up our python knowledge without external support from anyone. 

## Table of Contents
Here's the general game plan for the day.

### 0. Setting Up Our Environment
Before we get into writing our code, we will have to install a few programs and tools. It may take about a half hr to pull off but ultimately a properly established development environment will pay off in spades as we navigate the rest of our day.
### 1. ABCs of Python
We will begin by exploring some of the basics of the python programming language. For example, how can we keep track of data in python? How does decision making work? Can we automate functionality so that we don't have to repeat ourselves? These are just some of the questions we'll tackle in this unit.
### 2. Scraping Webpages and APIs
Here we will apply what we have learned about the basics of python to do more useful things in terms of data accumulation. Specifically, we will look into how we can harvest data that might be useful for processing from online sources: webpages and publicly available APIs.
### 3. Data Wrangling 101
Assuming that we now know a thing or two about gathering data, we will now answer the following question: how do we clean data? How can we leverage loops and pythonic data structures to pull in and group relevant data we need for analysis?
### 4. Data Analysis
And finally, now that we have regular, easily grokkable information - how can we do useful things with it? What tools do we have at our disposal to easily make sense of the data we have accumulated?

[Hello, Wrold!](https://medium.com/@the_taqquikarim/console-log-hello-wrold-3e3abeb44396) I'm Taq, Senior Software Engineer at [Intersection](https://twitter.com/intersection_co). I'm also an Adjunct Professor at King's College, where I teach an intro to web devleopment class.

Currently, I'm teaching at remote Javascript Development class (also at GA) - my second foray into the world of remote instruction (it's awkward, but exciting!). In the past, I've taught some form of coding at institutions such as C4Q, The Startup Institute, NYCDA, and Columbia Splash.
